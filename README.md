# Kmeans-clustering-on-customer-data
A mall customers data given into different analysis and clustering methods
1. Pairplotting : we can observe the relation between the different variables we have in our dataset,  making a differentiation between women and man, for each value of each variable. The pink colour can be found in a higher ratio than the blue one, since there are more women than men.

2. Age and annual income : In this graph, we can say people whose age lays between thirty and fifty years old seem to get better jobs since they might be better prepared or be already more experienced than younglings . In the graphic we can also see how males tend to earn a little bit more money than females, at least until fifty years old.

3. Age and spending score : young people tend to spend way more than older people.

4. Spending score and annual income : annual income leads to having a higher spending score, specially for women. the majority of people in the middle, people who have decent salaries and have a reasonably high spending score.

After this data representation we can continue with our kmeans clustering.
So , if new data is added there wont be any problem with the dataset
